CSE 302 Lab 4 Tests
-------------------

This repository contains several tests for the BXII compiler.

* `bad/`: tests that should fail
* `good/`: tests that should succeed

Note that tests no longer have a r_ prefix.

Where applicable, a .bx file is accompanied by a .expected file that
gives the expected output of the program.
